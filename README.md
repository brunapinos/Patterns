Repository dedicated to studies of Design Patterns 

## Run Application

In each package it will be placed a file with a design pattern application.

To compile and run an example:

	javac filepath/filename.java
	java filepath/filename 
	


So if you want to run the example **DoorHouse.java** from **_AbstractFactory_**, execute this command:
	
	javac creational/AbstractFactory/DoorHouse.java
	java creational/AbstractFactory/DoorHouse
